# Source Code Export and GitHub Setup

## ðŸ“‹ Ready to Push - Complete Steps

Your Scheduler-Lite application is now ready for GitHub! Here's exactly what to do:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it: `scheduler-lite`
3. Description: `Multi-team scheduling platform with role-based access control, Google Calendar integration, and comprehensive API`
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

## Step 2: Push Your Code

Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Check if you have a remote already
git remote -v

# If you see a remote, remove it first (optional)
git remote remove origin

# Add your new GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/scheduler-lite.git

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Scheduler-Lite multi-team scheduling platform
